app.use(...)
This is a Middleware Function that will be triggered for every request (any route, any method like GET/POST).

(req, res) => { ... }
This is the Callback / RequestHandler Function (middleware) that runs when a request hits the server.

It receives two objects:
req: the request object
res: the response object

res.end("Hello from the Server");
This ends the response and sends "Hello from the Server" to the client.
Itâ€™s a low-level method. It just closes the response and sends plain text.
