/*

When we initialize a Node JS module (typically with npm init), it creates a package.json file. That file is the manifest for your Project (a file that describes important information about a project or package) such that npm and other tools use it to understand metadata, dependencies, scripts, versioning, entry points, etc.

package.json contains:
-> Basic Project Info
    name â†’ Name of your Project. 
    version â†’ Current Version of your Project.
    description â†’ Short description of what the Project does.    
    author â†’ Author Name.
    license â†’ Type of License.

-> Scripts
    scripts â†’ Custom Commands you can run using   npm run <script>.

    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "dev": "nodemon index.js",
      "test": "jest"
    }

-> Dependencies
    dependencies â†’ Packages your Project needs to run in Production.
    
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.18.2",
      "mongoose": "^7.2.0"
    }

-> Dev Dependencies
devDependencies â†’ Packages needed only for Development (e.g., testing tools, linters).

    "devDependencies": {
      "nodemon": "^2.0.22",
      "eslint": "^8.43.0"
    }

/*

The caret ^/~ is a version range operator in npm. It tells npm:
Install the latest minor or patch version, as long as the major version stays the same.

# Why we use ^/~
Because it:
-> Keeps your app up-to-date with safe updates (bug fixes and small new features)
-> Avoids dangerous big updates that may break your app

Minimum version: 4.18.2
Maximum version: less than 5.0.0 (i.e., ^4.18.2 allows anything from 4.18.2 up to but not including 5.0.0)

where as, 4.18.2 is a Version Number. 
4  ->  Major
18 ->  Minor
2  ->  Patch

ðŸ”´ Major (4)
-> Big changes.
-> May break old code (not backward-compatible).
-> Example: 4.x.x â†’ 5.0.0 means big breaking updates.

ðŸŸ¡ Minor (18)
-> New features added.
-> Old code still works (backward-compatible).
-> Example: 4.18.2 â†’ 4.19.0 adds a new feature.

ðŸŸ¢ Patch (2)
-> Bug fixes only.
-> No new features.
-> Example: 4.18.2 â†’ 4.18.3 fixes a small issue.
