/*

What's Happening Internally:

  -> Node.js starts your script on the main thread.
  -> It sees 5 crypto.pbkdf2 calls â€” all are asynchronous.
  -> These are offloaded to the libuv Thread Pool.
  -> By default, the thread pool has 4 threads (UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=4).

  So:
  -> 4 tasks are picked immediately (say, 1 to 4).
  -> The 5th (task 5) waits in a queue until one of the 4 threads becomes free.
