/*

The reason /hello and /server are also showing "Namaste from the Dashboard" is because of how app.use() works in Express.

-> app.use("/", ...) matches every route that starts with /.
-> That includes /, /hello, /server, /anything-you-can-think-of.
-> Since it comes before your /hello route, it gets executed first, and because it sends a response, the request ends there â€” later routes are never reached.

#NOTE : Order of writing the Code (Route) matter a lot.
