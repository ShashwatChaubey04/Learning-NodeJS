Waterfall Model of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) along with the roles involved at each stage:

1. Requirements → PM & Designer
What happens: Gathering complete requirements for the software before any design or coding begins.
Who is responsible:
PM (Project Manager) — understands client needs, manages scope.
Designer — works on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) aspects.

2. Design → Senior Engineer / EM
What happens: Creating the technical design — system architecture, database schema, and detailed specifications.
Who is responsible:
Senior Engineer — designs architecture and frameworks.
EM (Engineering Manager) — oversees technical planning.

3. Development → SDE1, SDE2
What happens: Writing the actual code according to the design.
Who is responsible:
SDE1 (Software Development Engineer I) — usually junior/mid-level developers.
SDE2 — more experienced developers handling complex tasks.

4. Testing → SDET
What happens: Checking for bugs, performance issues, and ensuring the software meets requirements.
Who is responsible:
SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) — automates and executes test cases.

5. Deployment → DevOps
What happens: Moving the tested code to production so users can access it.
Who is responsible:
DevOps Engineers — handle CI/CD pipelines, server setup, and cloud deployments.

6. Maintenance
What happens: Fixing bugs, updating features, and keeping the software running after release.
Who is responsible:
Could involve developers, testers, and support engineers.

Waterfall Model (SDLC)
-> The process flows step by step — one stage must be completed before moving to the next.
-> Unlike Agile, there is little backtracking.
